# Grēne: grene-gardening-app

## Purpose
The purpose of Grēne is two-fold:
1. Build a full stack app from the ground up to to cement some newly acquired skills, while honing existing ones.
2. Create a useful gardening app for release to the general public

## Stack
Rather than start off with package like create-react-app, I want to build this project from the ground up, including all the installs, webpack setup, etc. Granted, its not the most efficient way to start, but this choice helps me fulfill Purpose #1. 

Starting out, I plan on using the following technologies. As I move through development, my needs or opinions might change, at which point I will update this list with the new tech and my reasoning for including it. I should point out that this is very much an exercise in digging into backend technologies and some of it will be learn-as-I-go. 

- React
- Redux
- Typescript
- Node / Express
- GraphQL?
- Firebase or MongoDB?

## Why Grēne?
Along with being a developer, I also have a degree in English. I've always been fascinated with the Germanic roots of the language, and with the infusion of Latin influence via the French brought by [William the Conquer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_the_Conqueror)'s court after his successful invasion of the British Isles in 1066. Grēne is the Old English precursor to our word "green," and has its roots (pun intended) in Northern European languages. So, yeah. I called it Grēne because I'm a nerd. Go figure.

## License
I'm licensing this under the strong copyleft [GNU Affero General Public License v3.0](https://opensource.org/licenses/AGPL-3.0). The intent here is not to discourage other developers from using or contributing, but rather to keep my options open as I move forward. I figure I can replace this with one less restrictive if it looks like that might be the right decision.
